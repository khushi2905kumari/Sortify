          Sorting Algorithms

            <p>
                Sorting algorithms are used to sort a data structure according to a specific order relationship, such as numerical order or lexicographical order. <br/><br/>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This operation is one of the most important and widespread in computer science. For a long time, new methods have been developed to make this procedure faster and faster.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are currently hundreds of different sorting algorithms, each with its own specific characteristics. They are classified according
                to two metrics: space complexity and time complexity.<br/><br/>Those two kinds of complexity are represented with asymptotic notation, mainly with the symbols O, <span class="symbol">Œò</span>, <span class="symbol">Œ©</span>, representing respectively the upper bound, the tight bound, and the lower bound of the algorithm's complexity, specifying in brackets an expression in terms of <code><var>n</var></code>, the number of the elements of the data structure.<br /><br /> Most of them fall into two categories:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Logarithmic<br />
                    The complexity is proportional to the binary logarithm (i.e to the base 2) of <code><var>n</var></code>.<br /> An example of a logarithmic sorting algorithm is Quick sort, with space and time complexity O<code>(n √ó log n)</code>.<br /><br />
                </li>
                
                <li> Quadratic<br /> The complexity is proportional to the square of <code><var>n</var></code >.<br /> An example of a quadratic sorting algorithm is Bubble sort, with a time complexity of O<code>(n<sup>2</sup>)</code>.<br />
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                Space and time complexity can also be further subdivided into 3 different cases: best case, average case and worst case.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sorting algorithms can be difficult to understand and it's easy to get confused. We believe visualizing sorting algorithms can be a great way to better understand their functioning while having fun!
